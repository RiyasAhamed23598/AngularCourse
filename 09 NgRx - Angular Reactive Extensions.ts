// What is NgRx?
// ######################################################################################################

// NgRx (Angular Reactive Extensions) is a framework for building reactive applications in Angular.
// It's a state management library that implements the Redux pattern using RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)
//    to manage the application state in a reactive and predictable way.
// NgRx provides a set of libraries for managing the global state, side effects, and entity collections, among other functionalities.
// It's particularly useful in large-scale applications where managing state in an efficient, predictable, centralized, scalable and maintainable way is critical.

// ######################################################################################################

// The Model file declares the data types which represent the module's entities, ensuring strong typing.
// These types define the data structures that will be managed by the NgRx State (will be described soon). Example:

export interface ICustomer {
  customerId: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  orders: IOrder[];
  updatedBy string;
  updatedAt Date;
}

export interface IOrder {
  orderId: number;
  orderDate: Date;
  products: IProduct[];
  updatedBy string;
  updatedAt Date;
}

export interface IProduct {
  productId: number;
  productName: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number; // quantity of the product in the order
  updatedBy string;
  updatedAt Date;
}

// ######################################################################################################
// * State
// ######################################################################################################

// At high level, an application is a collection of modules.
// Each module normally represents a single domain/area and includes a screen (and dependent popup screens it opens, if any).
// State refers to a singleton object that holds all the data of a module as it is at the current moment (i.e. the current state of the module).

// A module usually consists of a few components:

// - The parent, module-level component - the top-level container, i.e. the visual "skeleton" of the main screen of the domain.
//      Its HTML template defines the general outline of the screen and where each child component is located (using the child components' selector tags).
//      Here you can see the HTML of a real parent component I developed - it contains some screen areas, buttons and a Tab control, but not its own data fields:
//      https://github.com/Ursego/AngularTypeScriptCSharpCodeExamples/blob/main/4%20Angular/data-chg-sub/data-chg-sub.component.html

// - Child components to render different areas of the main screen.
//      For example, in the just mentioned real parent component you can see this line:
        <app-data-chg-sub-card [contextDataChgSub]="contextDataChgSub"></app-data-chg-sub-card>
//      The app-data-chg-sub-card selector identifies the component defined in
//      https://github.com/Ursego/AngularTypeScriptCSharpCodeExamples/blob/main/4%20Angular/data-chg-sub/data-chg-sub-card/data-chg-sub-card.component.ts
//      So, the following HTML will be rendered on the selector's place:
//      https://github.com/Ursego/AngularTypeScriptCSharpCodeExamples/blob/main/4%20Angular/data-chg-sub/data-chg-sub-card/data-chg-sub-card.component.html
//      Note using the word Card. It is in Angular slang what Form is in other frameworks (i.e. a group of fields describing the details of a single database record).

// - Components for dependent screens opened from the main screen. They can be opened by either the parent or a child component.
//      Note that we don't call them child components - thay are the top-level components of their own screen (since there are no other components there).

// Each component has a dedicated data structure in the State of the module it belongs to.

// As an example, let's consider a Customer module. That screen is extremely unrealistic, but its entities are convenient for explaining the concept.

// CustomerComponent is the highest-level container. It has the following visual structure:
// * On the left side - a narrow vertical panel which is displayed always. It includes:
//    ** A customer search widget (CustomerSearchComponent) with input fields to search by, and a Search button.
//    ** A list of customers (CustomerListComponent) found by the entered search criteria.
// * When the user selects a customer in the list, the main part of the screen displays info for the selected customer:
//      ** The customer details card (CustomerCardComponent).
//      ** A list of the customer's orders (OrderListComponent).
// * When the user clicks an order, the screen displays info for the selected order:
//      ** The order details card (OrderCardComponent).
//      ** A list of the products included in the order (ProductListComponent).
//            When the user double-clicks a product in the list, a details card dialog pops up (ProductCardComponent).

// Each entity has the CRUD functionality.

// Notice the naming convention:
// - List components: <Entity>ListComponent.
// - Card components: <Entity>CardComponent.
// - Other types have neither "List" nor "Card" in their names: CustomerComponent, CustomerSearchComponent.

// Here is the datatype (model) for the State (ICustomerState) which describes the entire screen's data:

import { ICustomer, IOrder, IProduct } from 'src/models/customer.model';

export interface ICustomerState {
  customerList: ICustomer[]; // list of customers
  customerListLoaded: boolean; // when false, display a progress bar in place of the data fields
  contextCustomer: ICustomer | null; // details form for the currently selected customer
  contextCustomerLoaded: boolean;

  orderList: IOrder[]; // list of orders of the currently selected customer
  orderListLoaded: boolean;
  contextOrder: IOrder | null; // details form for the currently selected order
  contextOrderLoaded: boolean;

  productList: IProduct[]; // list of products of the currently selected order
  productListLoaded: boolean;
  contextProduct: IProduct | null; // details form dialog for the double-clicked product
  contextProductLoaded: boolean;
}

// As you see, the State doesn't hold references to component instances - it only contains their data.  
// When components are created, they work with this data only.

// Component classes may have properties for the same fields, but these are just temporary storage to facilitate local data manipulations within the Components.
// The usual workflow:
// 1. A value is copied from the state to a property of the component class (and automatically rendered in the HTML if it has a linked control).
// 2. That local copy of the data is processed in the component (either by user interaction or programmatically).
// 3. The changed value is saved in the state which makes the change permanent.
//      The component can change the state directly by dispatching an Action, but it's not a common scenario.
//      Usually, the component dispatches an Action which saves data in the DB by calling a web service.
//      After that, the respective SuccessAction updates the State with the change.
//      Now all three the copies of the value - in the DB, in the State and in the component class - are in sync.

// State:
// * Centralizes data management providing a single source of truth for the module's data.
// * Ensures that all parts of the module are synchronized with the same version of the data.
// * Simplifies communication between components by avoiding direct data sharing and, worse, multiple "main" copies of the same data.
// * Ensures that growing amounts of data are handled efficiently and predictably.

// In NgRx, State is immutable, meaning it cannot be directly modified.
// Eeach change creates a new instance of State and makes the old instance a subject to the garbage collector.
// That prevents accidental modifications and ensures predictability and reliable debugging.

// @@@ The Initial State:

// In addition to declaring the State type (ICustomerState), you must also create the Initial State object of that type, with all the fields having default values:
export const initialCustomerState: ICustomerState = {
  // Customer:
  customerList: [],
  customerListLoaded: false,
  contextCustomer: null,
  contextCustomerLoaded: false,
  // Order:
  orderList: [],
  orderListLoaded: false,
  contextOrder: null,
  contextOrderLoaded: false,
  // Product:
  productList: [],
  productListLoaded: false,
  contextProduct: null,
  contextProductLoaded: false
};
// This object is usually created in same Model file which declares the State's data type.
// If the State's data type is changed later, it's convenient to synchronize the Initial State since it's right there at hand.

// The Initial State is crucial since it:
// * Provides a clear and consistent starting point for the module's State.
// * Ensures that the state is always defined, even before any data is retrieved.

// Later, when you learn about Reducers, you will see that the initialCustomerState object is passed to the createReducer function.

// ######################################################################################################
// * Store
// ######################################################################################################

// While State is a module-level container, Store is an application-level container (in fact, a container of containers).
// The Store instance is a singleton object that holds the States of multiple modules combined, which makes up the state of the whole application.

// The Store is the "single source of truth" for the application state/data.
// This simply means that our application state has only one global, centralized source.

// The Store provides a way to access the states of different modules, dispatch Actions, and subscribe to state changes.
// You can think of it as a database that you can get access in order to retrieve or update the data that the application operates on.

// The Store is an observable, and components can subscribe to it to get updates when the state changes.

// The Store is a state-management solution inspired by the famous library Redux.
// Redux popularized the idea of organizing the application state into simple objects and updating this state by replacing it with a new state.
// This means that the object shouldn't be mutated directly, but rather should be replaced with a new object which contains the new version of the data.

// You don't declare the Store data type, and don't instantiate it - Angular does all that for you, creating a Store instance as injectible.
// You only need to inject it into your components so they can read and update it.

// Here is a sample component for the Customer List.
// It's incomplete and created only to demonstrate how components work with the Store:

import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { Observable, Subscription } from 'rxjs';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { ICustomer } from 'src/models/customer.model';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-customers-list',
  template: '<the HTML template URL>'
})
export class CustomerListComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  customerList$: Observable<ICustomer[]>;
  private _customerList: ICustomer[] = [];

  contextCustomer$: Observable<ICustomer>;
  private _contextCustomer!: ICustomer;

  // A pointer to the application's Store is injected into the constructor:
  constructor(private _store: Store<any>) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    // Populate the observables from the Store:
    this.customerList$ = this._store.select('customerList');
    this.contextCustomer$ = this._store.select('contextCustomer');
    // The parameters passed to the select() functions are strings with the names of the current module's State properties, as defined in the model.  
    // Even though the entire Store is queried, only data from the current module's State is subscribed to.  
    // This means different modules (screens) can have fields with the same names in their States without interfering with each other.
    // So, if another module has the contextCustomer field in its model, it will be ignored by select('contextCustomer') in CustomerListComponent.

    // Populate the regular vars from the observables (to work with the data in the imperative way, if needed):
    this._s.add(
      this.customerList$.subscribe((customers: ICustomer[]) => { this._customerList = customers; })
    );
    this._s.add(
      this.contextCustomer$.subscribe((customer: ICustomer) => { this._contextCustomer = customer; })
    );
  }
}

// Note that any components of the module can access any properties of the module's state - even those which store data for other components of the same module.
// For example, if another component of the module needs to get the context customer, it will do the same call in its component class:
this.contextCustomer$ = this._store.select('contextCustomer');
// That eliminates the need to pass that customer from the parent component's template to the child components.

// The this._store.select('contextCustomer') method makes this.contextCustomer$ subscribe to the changes of contextCustomer in the Store.
// So, if any component changes contextCustomer of the module's State, all the subscribing components are immediately updated as well.

// @@@ What is an Angular application?

// As mentioned, the Store is a singleton — there's only one Store instance per Angular application.  
// You might ask: "What if I open several browser tabs for different customers? Shouldn't the properties of ICustomerState be arrays?"  
// Here's the clarification: Angular applications follow the SDI (Single Document Interface) model, not MDI (Multiple Document Interface).  
// Only one screen is active at a time, but you can open multiple instances of the application.  
// So, each browser tab runs its own separate instance of the Angular app with its own singleton Store.

// ######################################################################################################
// * Action
// ######################################################################################################

// An Action is a plain TypeScript object used to express an event or an intention (usually a data manipulation or a change in the application's state).  
// Actions are dispatched (i.e. launched) in one part of the application (usually in components or services) and captured in others.  
// NgRx automatically manages the chain of fired events when an Action is dispatched, ensuring the appropriate consumers respond to it seamlessly.  
// Actions provide an easy global communication channel. They are one of the main building blocks in NgRx.

// The Action file is a module-level file, like the other files which will be described soon - Service, Effect and Reducer.
// Each file serves all the components of the module - CustomerCardComponent, OrderCardComponent and ProductCardComponent.

// An Action object has two properties:  
//   * type – a textual description of the intention.  
//   * payload (optional) – additional data required for the action (like retrieval parameters), used to enforce type safety when the Action is dispatched.  

// An Action is created and returned by the createAction() factory function, which accepts type and payload.  
// The next example defines a few simple Actions. No payload, so only type is passed to createAction().  
// It's a good practice to add the word "Action" to the names of Action objects:
import { createAction } from '@ngrx/store';
export const incrementAction = createAction('[Counter] Increment');
export const decrementAction = createAction('[Counter] Decrement');
export const resetAction = createAction('[Counter] Reset');

// @@@ Action TYPE - the 1st parameter to createAction()

// Must be unique across the entire application since it serves as a unique identifier for each Action.
// Having duplicate action types can lead to unintended consequences.

// Conventionally, the Action type consista of two parts:
"[Module] Description"
// "[Module]" (within square brackets) indicates the feature module where the action is used. For application-wide Actions, use [App].
// "Description" reflects the specific event that is fired.
// This structure allows different Modules to have Actions with a same Description, like '[Customer] Save' and '[Order] Save'.

// @@@ Action PAYLOAD - the 2nd parameter (optional) to createAction()

// Describes the payload (additional data) expected by the Action. That data must be provided when the Action is dispatched.
// The argument prevents sending wrong data to the Action, i.e. inforces strong typing.

// The payload is sent to createAction() as the 2nd parameter via the props<T>() function, for example:
import { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store';
export const insTodoAction = createAction('[Todo List] Insert', props<{ todoText: string }>());

// props<T>() takes a generic type parameter, which is the data type of the payload for compile-time type checking to ensure correct payload structure.
// In the example above, the props() defines that the action should carry a payload with a property `todoText` of type `string`, so a correct dispatch looks like this:
this._store.dispatch(insTodoAction({ todoText: 'Learn NgRx' }));
// The next calls will cause compilation-time errors:
this._store.dispatch(insTodoAction({ todoText: 123 })); // doesn't match the required data type - 'todoText' must be a string
this._store.dispatch(insTodoAction({ text: 'Learn NgRx' })); // doesn't match the required data type - 'text' is not defined in the props

// Note that the dispatch() method belongs to the Store singleton - that illustrates the application-wide scope of Actions.
// Usually, Action files of different modules are grouped together in a folder under the app's Store folder, like src/app/Store/actions/.

// The next example describes the Action file which could exist for the Customer screen we used earlier.
// Firstly, the file declares a private enum each constant of which will be used as the type of an Action.

// Note that:
//   * Each CRUD operation of each entity has its dedicated Action.
//   * Each main CRUD Action has its own ...Success action. The Success action is dispatched if its main Action was executed successfully.

import { createAction } from '@ngrx/store';
import { ICustomer, IOrder, IProduct } from 'src/models/customer.model';

const m = '[Customer]'; // m = Module
const c = 'Customer';
const o = 'Order';
const p = 'Product';

enum d { // the Actions' "d"escriptions
  // Customer:
  SetContextCustomer = `${m} Set Context ${c}`, // displatched when a customer is highlighted in the customers list
  SelCustomerList = `${m} Select ${c} List`,
  SelCustomerListSuccess = `${SelCustomerList} Success`,
  SelCustomer = `${m} Select ${c}`,
  SelCustomerSuccess = `${SelCustomer} Success`,
  InsCustomer = `${m} Insert ${c}`,
  InsCustomerSuccess = `${InsCustomer} Success`,
  UpdCustomer = `${m} Update ${c}`,
  UpdCustomerSuccess = `${UpdCustomer} Success`,
  DelCustomer = `${m} Delete ${c}`,
  DelCustomerSuccess = `${DelCustomer} Success`,
  // Order:
  SelOrderList = `${m} Select ${o} List`,
  SelOrderListSuccess = `${SelOrderList} Success`,
  SelOrder = `${m} Select ${o}`,
  SelOrderSuccess = `${SelOrder} Success`,
  InsOrder = `${m} Insert ${o}`,
  InsOrderSuccess = `${InsOrder} Success`,
  UpdOrder = `${m} Update ${o}`,
  UpdOrderSuccess = `${UpdOrder} Success`,
  DelOrder = `${m} Delete ${o}`,
  DelOrderSuccess = `${DelOrder} Success`,
  // Product:
  SelProductList = `${m} Select ${p} List`,
  SelProductListSuccess = `${SelProductList} Success`,
  SelProduct = `${m} Select ${p}`,
  SelProductSuccess = `${SelProduct} Success`,
  InsProduct = `${m} Insert ${p}`,
  InsProductSuccess = `${InsProduct} Success`,
  UpdProduct = `${m} Update ${p}`,
  UpdProductSuccess = `${UpdProduct} Success`,
  DelProduct = `${m} Delete ${p}`,
  DelProductSuccess = `${DelProduct} Success`,
}

// Then, the Action file declares the Action objects themselves.

// In most enterprise applications, dispatching an Action calls a function of a Web Service, so our example reflects that.
// The props parameter to the createAction() function describes the Action's payload:
//   * The payload of a regular (non-Success) CRUD Action defines the INPUT of the Web Service function the Action calls.
//   * The payload of a Success CRUD Action defines the OUTPUT of the same Web Service function.

// Customer:
export const setContextCustomerAction = createAction(d.SetContextCustomer, props<{ actionCustomer: ICustomer | null }>());
export const selCustomerListAction = createAction(d.SelCustomerList, props<{ actionLastName: string }>()); // grab customers whose last name contains actionLastName

export const updOrderAction = createAction(d.UpdOrder, props<{ actionOrder: IOrder }>());
export const updOrderSuccessAction = createAction(d.UpdOrderSuccess, props<{ actionOrder: IOrder }>());
export const delOrderAction = createAction(d.DelOrder, props<{ actionOrderId: number }>());
export const delOrderSuccessAction = createAction(d.DelOrderSuccess, props<{ actionOrderId: number }>());
// Product:
export const selProductListAction = createAction(d.SelProductList, props<{ actionOrderId: number }>()); // grab products of this order

export const delProductAction = createAction(d.DelProduct, props<{ actionOrderId: number, actionProductId: number }>()); // delete the product from the order
export const delProductSuccessAction = createAction(d.DelProductSuccess, props<{ actionProductId: number }>());

// === END OF THE Action FILE ===

// Here are sample lines in the CustomerCardComponent which dispatch some Actions (of course, they would be in different parts of the component class):
this._store.dispatch(selCustomerListAction({ actionLastName: this._lastName }));
this._store.dispatch(selCustomerAction({ actionCustomerId: highlightedCustomerId })); // highlightedCustomerId is a param of delCustomer() function called from the template
this._store.dispatch(insCustomerAction({ actionCustomer: this._contextCustomer }));
this._store.dispatch(updCustomerAction({ actionCustomer: this._contextCustomer }));
this._store.dispatch(delCustomerAction({ actionCustomerId: this._contextCustomer.customerId }));

// There are a few rules to writing good actions within your application:
// * Upfront - write actions before developing features to understand and gain a shared knowledge of the feature being implemented.
// * Divide - categorize actions based on the event source.
// * Many - actions are inexpensive to write, so the more actions you write, the better you express flows in your application.
// * Event-Driven - capture events not commands as you are separating the description of an event and the handling of that event.

// ######################################################################################################
// * Service
// ######################################################################################################

// The class for outsourcing logic and data that directly calls the web service.  
// It's the "last station" of data flow within Angular before the data is sent to the middle tier on the Web.  
// The class name simply says "Service", but think of it as "web service."  
// Strictly speaking, this class is not a part of the NgRx library, but it's commonly found in apps that interact with a web service, which is the standard architecture.

// Typically, Services are injected into other areas of our app, so they must have the @Injectable decorator.
// The next Service is injected into the Effect class (which will be described next):

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { baseUrl } from 'src/app/common/navigation';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { ICustomer, IOrder, IProduct } from 'src/models/customer.model';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class CustomerService {
  private readonly _customersUrl = `${baseUrl}/customers`;
  private readonly _ordersUrl = `${baseUrl}/orders`;
  private readonly _productsUrl = `${baseUrl}/products`;

  constructor(private _http: HttpClient) {}

  // Customer:

  selCustomerList(lastName: string): Observable<ICustomer[]> {
    return this._http.get<ICustomer[]>(this._customersUrl, lastName);
  }

  selCustomer(customerId: number): Observable<ICustomer> {
    return this._http.get<ICustomer>(`${this._customersUrl}/${customerId}`, customerId);
  }

  insCustomer(customer: ICustomer): Observable<ICustomer> { // it also returns the inserted customer with the ID genereted by the DB
    return this._http.post<ICustomer>(`${this._customersUrl}/ins`, customer)
  }

  updCustomer(customer: ICustomer): Observable<ICustomer> { // it also returns the updated customer with the updatedBy & updatedAt genereted by the DB

  }

  // Order:

  // < ... A SIMILAR FRAGMNENT FOR ORDER FUNCTIONS HERE, USING this._ordersUrl ... >

  // Product:

  // < ... A SIMILAR FRAGMNENT FOR PRODUCT FUNCTIONS HERE, USING this._productsUrl ... >
}
// Notice that the generic type parameter, passed to the HTTP functions - get(), post(), put() & delete() - describes the type, returned by the web service - not the type sent to it.
// For example, selCustomerList passes ICustomer[] - get<ICustomer[]> - since an array of customers is expected from the web service.

// Also notice that the HTTP functions must fit the HTTP request types, expected by the web service, as well as the URLs must be parsable by the web service.
// Here's the suggested URL convention:

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CRUD OPERATION:      HTTP:   THE MAIN (PARENT) ENTITY:  A CHILD ENTITY:
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SELECT all entities  GET     /entities                  /entities/{parentEntityId}/child_entities
// SELECT an entity     GET     /entities/{entityId}       /entities/{parentEntityId}/child_entities/{childEntityId}
// INSERT an entity     POST    /entities/ins              /entities/{parentEntityId}/child_entities/ins
// UPDATE an entity     PUT     /entities/upd/{entityId}   /entities/{parentEntityId}/child_entities/upd/{childEntityId}
// DELETE an entity     DELETE  /entities/del/{entityId}   /entities/{parentEntityId}/child_entities/del/{childEntityId}
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The INSERT URL doesn't include the ID - obviously, that ID has not been generated by the database yet. Instead, an object of ICustomer type is sent:
  insCustomer(customer: ICustomer): Observable<ICustomer> {
    return this._http.post<ICustomer>(`${this._customersUrl}/ins`, customer)
  }
// An object of ICustomer type is also sent to the UPDATE web service, and it contains the ID.
// So, there is no need to add the ID to the URL for UPDATE. But we do that for the user to see consistent URLs across the app.

// We can create services with commands:
ng generate service MyService
ng g s MyService

// ######################################################################################################
// * Effect
// ######################################################################################################

// Side effects are operations that happen outside the Angular context, such as calling external APIs, making HTTP requests, or accessing local storage.  
// If your application needs to perform a side effect, you define an Effect class.  

// Effects are built using RxJS Observables and are designed to listen for specific Actions and perform side effects without directly modifying the Store.  
// The Effect class captures a dispatched main (i.e. non-"Success") Action and calls the corresponding method in the Web Service class.  
// After that call, the Effect is also the "first station" within Angular to handle the data returned from the middle tier via the Web Service.  
// Once a side effect is successfully completed, the Effect typically dispatches the respective "Success" Action to update the Store with the results returned by the Web Service.  

// We'll use the Customer screen to demonstrate how Effects handle side effects.
// The class name uses just "Effect" for brevity, but it stands for "Side Effect":

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

// * Reducer
// ######################################################################################################

// Reducer is a pure function which defines how the State of your module changes in response to Actions.
// It listens for dispatched Actions; when an Action, requiring handling, is captured, the Reducer modifies the State based on the current State and the Action's data.
// That is done in an immutable way, creating a new State object. Angular discards the old State object, replacing it with the new one.

// The mission of the Reducer is critical – it's responsible for updating the State with the results of the Web Service calls when a ...Success Action is dispatched by the Effect.

// Also, you can create and dispatch an Action which updates the State without calling side effects - like those without "Success" in the example below.
// That is the correct way, we don't update the State in other spots of the application. Instead, these spots dispatch Actions which signal the Reducer to change the State.
// Reducer is one centralized file with all State updates for the given module, that significantly simplifies debugging.

// Here is an example Reducer file for our Customer module:

import { Action, createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';
import * as _ from 'lodash';
import { ICustomerState, initialCustomerState } from '../states/customer.state';
import { ICustomer, IOrder, IProduct } from 'src/models/customer.model';
import {
  // Customer:
  setContextCustomerAction,
  selCustomerListAction,
  selCustomerListSuccessAction,
  selCustomerSuccessAction,
  insCustomerSuccessAction,
  updCustomerSuccessAction,
  delCustomerSuccessAction,
  // Order:
  // < ...ORDER ACTIONS HERE... >
  // Product:
  // < ...PRODUCT ACTIONS HERE... >
} from 'src/app/Store/actions/customer.action';

// A Reducer function takes two arguments - the current State and the latest Action dispatched - and returns a new State:
export function customerReducer(oldState: ICustomerState | undefined, action: Action): ICustomerState {
  return getNewState(oldState, action);
}

// If the Action is handled in the reducer function, the new State replaces the exisitng one, otherwise the exisitng State remains untouched:
const getNewState = createReducer(
  initialCustomerState, // notice that the initialCustomerState object is passed to the createReducer function

  // Customer:

  on(setContextCustomerAction, (state: ICustomerState, { actionCustomer: newContextCustomer }) => ({
    ...state, // copy all the properties of the old State to the new State unchanged...
    contextCustomer: newContextCustomer // ...and override contextCustomer whith the new value
  })),

  on(selCustomerListAction, (state: ICustomerState) => ({
    ...state,
   customerListLoaded: false // the retrieval has started, so display the progress bar
  })),

  on(selCustomerListSuccessAction, (state: ICustomerState, { actionCustomerList: selectedCustomerList }) => ({
    ...state,
    customerList: selectedCustomerList,
    customerListLoaded: true // the retrieval has finished, so hide the progress bar
  })),
  
  on(selCustomerAction, (state: ICustomerState) => ({
    ...state,
    customerLoaded: false // the retrieval has started, so display the progress bar
  })),

  on(selCustomerSuccessAction, (state: ICustomerState, { actionCustomer: selectedCustomer }) => ({
    ...state,
    contextCustomer: selectedCustomer,
    customerLoaded: true // the retrieval has finished, so hide the progress bar
  })),

  on(insCustomerSuccessAction, (state: ICustomerState, { actionCustomer: insertedCustomer }) => ({
    ...state,
    // Refresh the context Customer to populate the DB-generated fields - customerId, updatedBy & updatedAt:
    contextCustomer: insertedCustomer,
    // Add the INSERTed Table to the Customers List:
    customerList: [...state.customerList, insertedCustomer]
  })),

  on(updCustomerSuccessAction, (state: ICustomerState, { actionCustomer: updatedCustomer }) => ({
    ...state,
    // Refresh the context Customer to populate the DB-generated fields - updatedBy & updatedAt:
    contextCustomer: updatedCustomer,
    // Refresh the UPDATEd Customer in the Customers List:
    customerList: state.customerList.map(
      (customerInList: ICustomer) => customerInList.customerId === updatedCustomer.customerId ? updatedCustomer : customerInList
    )
  })),

  on(delCustomerSuccessAction, (state: ICustomerState, { actionCustomerId: deletedCustomerId }) => ({
    ...state,
    // Dispose of the DELETEd Customer:
    contextCustomer: null,
    // Remove the DELETEd Customer from the Customers List:
    customerList: state.customerList.filter(
      (customerInList: ICustomer) => customerInList.customerId !== deletedCustomerId
    )
  })),

  // Order:

  // < ...A SIMILAR FRAGMNENT FOR ORDER ACTIONS HERE... >

  // Product:

  // < ...A SIMILAR FRAGMNENT FOR PRODUCT ACTIONS HERE... >
);

// The spread operator (...state) only does shallow copying and does not handle deeply nested objects.
// You need to copy each level in the object to ensure immutability.
// There are libraries that handle deep copying including lodash and immer.

// ######################################################################################################
// * The Action's life cycle
// ######################################################################################################

// As you've seen, Actions fall into three categories:

// 1. Actions that are called from business logic and trigger external Effects (usually web services). They have corresponding Success Actions.
// A typical example is Actions for CRUD operations.
// Such Actions do not change the State with business data (only turn on the progress bar display flag).

// 2. Success Actions. Called from the Effect class in case of successful execution of the main Action.
// As you remember, their task is to update the State with the result, retuned by the Effect.
// By the way, some applications also use Failure Actions, called from the Effect class in case of an error in the main Action, if the State must be updated with the failure info.

// 3. Actions that are called from business logic and DO NOT trigger external Effects.
// Their task is to change the State by writing into it the data passed as payload by the calling business code.
// For example, SetContextCustomer receives data as a whole ICustomer object that was already stored on the client side because it was received from the web service earlier.
// Actions of this category are also used to "manually" change a specific field of the State - for example, write calculation results.
// Let me remind you once again that any physical changes to the State must be made only inside the Reducer.
// Despite the fact that any component has access to the State, changes must be made by dispatching Actions, and not by assigning values ​​to the State fields directly.

// Let's briefly summarize the life cycle stages that an Action goes through:

// Actions related to Effects (categories 1 & 2):

// 1. The component dispatches a regular (not Success) Action.
// 2. The Reducer captures it and updates the State to display the progress bar.
// 3. The Effect captures the Action and calls the corresponding function of the Service, passing the payload as an input.
// 4. The Service sends an HTTP request to the web service and is waiting for its result.
// 5. When an HTTP response is received, the Service function passes its output to the Effect.
// 6. If the call was successful, the Effect dispatches the respective Success Action, passing the results returned by the web service.
// 7. The Reducer captures the Success Action, updates the State with those results, and turns off the progress bar flag.

// Actions unrelated to Effects (category 3):

// 1. The component dispatches an Action.
// 2. The Reducer captures it and writes the payload to the State.
